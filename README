Compass is an implementation of a Smalltalk-like programming language. This
iteration does not implement many of the planned improvements over Smalltalk,
such as package management, private methods, and "securelevels".

The compiler is implemented in Python, and the bytecode interpreter is in C.
The test cases are in compass/pcc/test, and can be run by running
"./testAll interpreter" in that directory, once the interpreter and assembler
have been compiled (by running "make" in their respective directories under
"bytecode").

The test scripts are the best examples of the Compass programming language,
and use the primitive runtime library included in the "compass/runtime"
directory.

Notice that some of the tests are supposed to throw exceptions, but the test
suite incorrectly prints the resultant error messages. All such tests are
commented as throwing an exception, and are named "exception*.cp".
