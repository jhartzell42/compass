TODO for Needle-final:
* Write exceptions.
* Allow public/private/abstract (but ignore for right now)
* Create #class method in compiler.
* Allow (but ignore) securelevel method syntax.
* Add test case where the ignored argument has side effects.
* Write aliasing.
* Write needle test cases (especially testing inheritence, ivars, and mixins)
* Write needle automated tester
* Write needle runtime
* Add globals to needle
* Add support for primitive arrays to needle/bytecode runtime.
This probably involves writing some methods in Compass, and others direct
in bytecode.
* Add support for array literals.
* Add full support for #()
* Implement package-declaration-ignoring multifile.
* Make it compatible with Dan's runtime.
* Begin devving the Compass compiler for Compass.
* Fix how receiver gets eval'd last.
* Implement arguments to blocks and methods other than @ and _.
